- Declare war
    - 8 hour warning = blitz, 80% offense effectiveness
    - 24 hour warning = 100% offense

- New attack wave every 15-30m
- Both sides declare how many units to send to attack

ATTACK APPLIED IN ORDER
- Nukes: destroys land, buildings, pop, units, resources?
- Air
    - Total jets vs defense jets + AA
    - Destroys air and ground units
- Land power
    - Destroys ground units
    - Captures land, bldgs, pop, resources?


- Only one war active at a time?
- War continues until neither side commits units or one side is destroyed

- Deploying tanks/jets costs 1 solider + 1 oil
- Units defending is just 1 solider?
